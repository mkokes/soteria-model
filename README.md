## 💚 Support Our Community

Donations to our [GoFundMe campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-local-CH-families) help provide direct aid such as groceries and rent assistance to members of the Columbia Heights, MN community. Your support is deeply appreciated.

## What Is This?

The Soteria Model is an open-source framework for building community-based mutual aid and protection networks. It provides organizational structures, security practices, and operational templates that any community can adapt to their local context.

**This is not software** — it's documentation. A field guide. A blueprint that communities can use to organize themselves effectively and safely.

## Key Features

- **Compartmentalized Structure**: Cells, segments, and stewards designed for security
- **Web of Trust**: Vouching-based membership that resists infiltration  
- **Federated & Autonomous**: No central authority; each community is independent
- **Multi-language**: Available in English, Spanish, Somali, and Arabic
- **Printable Materials**: Rights cards, flyers, and community resources
- **Privacy by Design**: No tracking, no analytics, no data collection

## Who Is This For?

- **Communities** seeking to organize mutual aid networks
- **Organizers** building protection infrastructure
- **Anyone** who wants to adapt this model for their local context

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions:

- **Translations**: Help translate content to additional languages
- **Content improvements**: Clarify language, fix errors, improve accessibility
- **Local adaptations**: Share how you've adapted the model (without operational details)

Please do **not** contribute:
- Operational details from any real network
- Member information or identities
- Location-specific sensitive information

## Principles

1. **Compartmentalization** — Segments don't overlap; information doesn't flow freely
2. **Vouching Over Recruitment** — Every member is personally vouched for
3. **Autonomy** — Each cell operates independently
4. **Privacy by Design** — Collect nothing unnecessary
5. **Replicability** — This model is designed to be copied
6. **Solidarity Over Charity** — Neighbors protecting neighbors
7. **Harm Reduction** — Meet people where they are
