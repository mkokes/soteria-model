# Technical Tools

**Secure platforms and technologies for safe cell coordination.**

The right tools make coordination safer and more effective. This page covers recommended platforms for cell operations, along with security considerations for each.

## Core Communication

### Signal

**What it is:** Encrypted messaging app for secure communication.

**Use for:**
- All cell coordination and communication
- Segment-specific groups
- Voice calls during active operations
- Sharing photos (with disappearing messages)

**Security features:**
- End-to-end encryption (only sender and recipient can read)
- Disappearing messages (auto-delete after set time)
- Screen lock and screen security
- Registration lock (prevents SIM-swap attacks)
- Minimal metadata retention

**What to avoid:**
- Don't share specific addresses in text (use photo method)
- Don't keep sensitive messages indefinitely (use disappearing messages)
- Don't screenshot sensitive information
- Don't use for public announcements (use other channels)

**Setup guide:** See [Signal Setup](/start-a-cell/signal-setup) for detailed configuration.

::: tip PRIMARY TOOL
Signal is the backbone of cell communication. Every member must have it properly configured before joining any segment.
:::

**Download:**
- iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669)
- Android: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
- Desktop: [signal.org/download](https://signal.org/download/)

## Secure Collaboration

### CryptPad

**What it is:** Encrypted, zero-knowledge collaborative documents and forms platform.

**Use for:**
- Creating secure intake forms for community members
- Collaborative document editing (meeting notes, planning docs)
- Polls and surveys within the cell
- Spreadsheets for coordination (not for storing sensitive data)

**Security features:**
- End-to-end encryption
- No account required (can use anonymously)
- Zero-knowledge architecture (CryptPad can't read your data)
- Self-destructing documents option
- No tracking or analytics

**What to avoid:**
- Don't store lists of vulnerable community members
- Don't keep permanent records of activities
- Don't use for long-term data storage
- Don't share CryptPad links on public platforms

**Access:** [cryptpad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) (free) or self-host for maximum security

## Anonymous Browsing

### Tor Browser

**What it is:** Browser that routes traffic through multiple servers to hide your location and identity.

**Use for:**
- Researching sensitive topics
- Accessing resources without revealing your location
- Communicating when you need maximum anonymity
- Accessing this documentation if you're concerned about surveillance

**Security features:**
- Routes traffic through multiple encrypted relays
- Hides your IP address and location
- Blocks trackers and fingerprinting
- Isolates each website you visit

**What to avoid:**
- Don't log into personal accounts while using Tor
- Don't download files through Tor (can reveal identity)
- Don't use for time-sensitive operations (it's slower)
- Don't assume it makes you completely invisible

**Download:** [torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/download/)

## Financial Privacy

### Cash

**What it is:** Physical currency. No digital trail.

**Use for:**
- All resource distribution to community members
- Reimbursing volunteers for expenses
- Purchasing supplies for the cell
- Any transaction where privacy matters

**Why it matters:**
- No bank records to subpoena
- No transaction history to trace
- No names attached to payments
- Immediate and final

**Best practices:**
- Keep receipts minimal or destroy them
- Don't use personal bank accounts for cell funds
- Distribute cash in person, never mail it
- Use small bills for easier distribution

---

## What NOT to Use

### ❌ Avoid These Platforms

**Facebook / Meta Products**
- Extensive tracking and data collection
- Cooperates with law enforcement
- Metadata reveals relationships and patterns
- Not end-to-end encrypted by default

**SMS / Text Messages**
- Not encrypted
- Stored by phone carriers
- Easily intercepted
- Subject to subpoena

**Email (for operational communication)**
- Metadata reveals sender, recipient, time
- Subject to subpoena
- Often stored indefinitely
- Not designed for real-time coordination

**Zoom / Google Meet (for sensitive discussions)**
- Company can access content
- Metadata logged
- Subject to subpoena
- Use Signal voice/video instead

**Venmo / PayPal / Cash App**
- Creates permanent transaction records
- Names and amounts are logged
- Subject to subpoena
- Use cash instead

## Tool Comparison

| Tool | Purpose | Encryption | Anonymity | Best For |
|------|---------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Signal** | Messaging | ✅ E2E | ⚠️ Phone number | Daily coordination |
| **CryptPad** | Documents | ✅ E2E | ✅ Anonymous | Collaborative editing |
| **Tor Browser** | Browsing | ✅ Layered | ✅ Anonymous | Research, access |
| **Cash** | Payments | N/A | ✅ Anonymous | All transactions |

## Security Principles for Tool Use

### 1. Use the Right Tool for the Job

Don't use Signal for public announcements. Don't use CryptPad for permanent storage. Don't use Tor for time-sensitive operations. Each tool has a purpose.

### 2. Assume Everything Digital Can Be Compromised

Even with encryption, assume that determined adversaries can eventually access data. Use disappearing messages. Don't store what you don't need.

### 3. Metadata Matters

Even if content is encrypted, metadata (who, when, how often) reveals patterns. Minimize digital footprints wherever possible.

### 4. Train Everyone

Tools are only secure if used correctly. Every member must complete security training before joining any segment.

## Getting Started

**For new cells:**

1. **Set up Signal first** — This is non-negotiable. See [Signal Setup Guide](/start-a-cell/signal-setup)
2. **Create a CryptPad account** — Use for collaborative planning during founding phase
3. **Install Tor Browser** — Have it ready for research and anonymous access
4. **Establish cash protocols** — Decide how funds will be handled before you need them

**For existing cells:**

1. **Audit current tools** — Are you using anything on the "avoid" list?
2. **Review Signal settings** — Ensure all members have proper configuration
3. **Test backup communication** — What if Signal goes down?
4. **Document tool usage** — Create simple guides for your specific context

::: warning REMEMBER
**The golden rule:** Use the right tool for the right job. Signal for coordination, CryptPad for temporary collaboration, cash for maximum financial privacy.
