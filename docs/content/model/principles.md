# Core Principles

These principles are non-negotiable. They define what makes the Soteria Model work.

## 1. Compartmentalization

**Segments don't overlap. Information doesn't flow freely.**

- Someone doing surveillance observation never knows transportation routes
- Someone distributing resources never knows safe house locations
- Coordinators know other coordinators, not every member

This protects everyone. What you don't know, you cannot reveal — whether through accident, coercion, or compromise.

### Pick a Lane — And Stay In It

**The most important rule: Join ONE segment. Stay in that role.**

When you join a cell, you choose a segment based on your skills, availability, and what the community needs. That becomes your lane. You don't cross into other segments. You don't help out "just this once" in another area. You don't satisfy curiosity about what other segments are doing.

**Why this matters:**

- **Curiosity is a security risk**: Asking "what are the Sentinels seeing?" or "where do Transporters take people?" creates vulnerability. The answer to "I don't know" is the strongest protection you can give someone.
- **Crossing segments creates exposure**: If you drive for Transporters one week and observe for Sentinels the next, you now know too much. If you're compromised, you can reveal both operations.
- **"Just helping" isn't helping**: The instinct to pitch in everywhere comes from good intentions, but it undermines the security model. Trust the structure.

### Consequences of Breaking Compartmentalization

Breaking compartmentalization doesn't just put you at risk — it puts everyone at risk:

| What Happens | The Damage |
|--------------|------------|
| One person knows multiple segments' activities | If arrested or coerced, they can reveal multiple operations |
| Information shared between segments | Creates a map of the entire network for anyone who intercepts it |
| Members "helping out" across segments | Destroys isolation, making the whole cell vulnerable to a single compromise |
| Casual conversation about other segments | Spreads information that should remain contained |

**If one person is compromised and knows everything, the entire network falls.**

Compartmentalization isn't bureaucracy. It's not about control. It's about **survival**. The structure protects you, protects the people you serve, and protects everyone else in the network.

### What Compartmentalization Looks Like in Practice

**Good:**
- "I'm a Transporter. I don't know what the Sentinels are doing, and I don't need to."
- "That's not my segment. Let me connect you with someone who handles that."
- "I focus on my role. Other segments focus on theirs."

**Bad:**
- "I usually do transportation, but I'll help with observation today."
- "I heard the Sentinels saw something yesterday — what was it?"
- "I know someone in Resources. Let me ask them about that situation."

**The test**: If you were arrested tomorrow, could you only reveal your own segment's activities? If the answer is no, you've crossed a boundary.

## 2. Vouching Over Recruitment

**Every member is personally vouched for by someone trusted.**

- No open applications, no public sign-ups
- A voucher takes responsibility for their referral
- Trust is built through relationship, not paperwork

This creates a **web of trust** that is resistant to infiltration.

## 3. Autonomy

**Each cell operates independently. There is no central authority.**

- No national organization to subpoena
- No database to seize
- No leader whose compromise takes down everything

Cells may share knowledge (updated legal info, security practices), but never operational details.

## 4. Privacy by Design

**We collect nothing we don't absolutely need.**

- No lists of vulnerable community members on any system
- No photos, addresses, or identifying information stored digitally
- Coordination happens through encrypted channels that disappear

The safest data is data that doesn't exist.

## 5. Replicability

**This model is designed to be copied.**

- The blueprint is public and open source
- Any community can fork it and adapt to local needs
- We succeed when this spreads, not when we grow

## 6. Solidarity Over Charity

**We are neighbors protecting neighbors, not providers serving clients.**

- Community members are participants, not recipients
- Those receiving support today may provide it tomorrow
- Everyone has something to contribute

## 7. Harm Reduction

**We meet people where they are.**

- We don't require documentation or proof of status
- We don't judge circumstances or decisions
- We provide what's needed without conditions

## Living These Principles

These aren't just words — they shape every decision:

| Decision | Principle Applied |
|----------|------------------|
| Should we keep a spreadsheet of rides given? | **No** — Privacy by Design |
| Can a Sentinel also do transportation? | **No** — Compartmentalization |
| Someone wants to join but nobody knows them | **Not yet** — Vouching |
| Another city wants our member list to coordinate | **No** — Autonomy |
| Should we brand ourselves prominently? | **Carefully** — Replicability over visibility |
