# Trust & Vouching

The Soteria Model doesn't use applications, background checks, or open recruitment. Instead, it uses a **web of trust** built through personal vouching.

## The Vouching Principle

**Every new member must be vouched for by an existing trusted member.**

The voucher:
- Knows the prospect personally
- Believes they share our values and can be trusted
- Takes responsibility for their referral
- Accompanies them through onboarding

No voucher = no entry. This is how we prevent infiltration.

## Trust Levels

Members progress through trust levels over time:

### Prospect

**Access**: Public information only (this website).

Someone who wants to join but hasn't been vouched yet. They may:
- Attend public Know Your Rights events
- Learn about the model
- Build relationships with existing members

**How to progress**: Find someone in the network willing to vouch for you.

---

### Probationary

**Access**: One segment, limited activities.

After vouching and initial vetting, new members enter a probationary period:
- Participate in lower-risk activities (supply sorting, business patronage)
- Observed by their voucher and segment lead
- Learn security practices in real situations
- Build trust through demonstrated commitment

**Duration**: Typically 2-3 months, but varies by cell.

**How to progress**: Complete probationary activities, demonstrate security awareness, confirmed by segment lead.

### Trusted Member

**Access**: Full segment participation, can vouch for others.

Trusted members are fully integrated:
- Full participation in their segment
- Can vouch for new prospects (after 3-6 months as trusted)
- May be considered for steward roles

**How to progress**: Continued commitment, demonstrated over time.

### Steward

**Access**: Coordination role with cross-segment visibility (limited).

See [Steward Roles](/model/stewards) for details.

## Vouching Responsibility

When you vouch for someone:

- You are putting your trust on the line
- If they cause harm, it reflects on you
- You should know them well enough to stake your reputation
- You commit to mentoring them through onboarding

**Don't vouch for**:
- People you just met
- People you only know online
- People pressuring you to vouch quickly
- Anyone who makes you hesitate

## When Someone Can't Find a Voucher

Some genuine people won't know anyone in the network. Options:

- **Public events**: Attend Know Your Rights trainings, community events, build relationships over time
- **Parallel networks**: Other mutual aid groups, faith communities, labor organizations may have overlap
- **Patience**: Trust takes time. This is a feature, not a bug.
