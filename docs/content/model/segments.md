# Segments

**Segments** are specialized teams within a cell, each with a distinct function. The key security feature: **segments are isolated from each other**.

## Core Segments

These are the foundational segments. Cells may adapt based on local needs.

### Sentinels (Observation & Rapid Response)

**Purpose**: Monitor and report suspicious activity to protect the community, and provide rapid response when community members are at risk.

**Activities**:
- Watch for unmarked vehicles conducting surveillance
- Note patterns of ICE or law enforcement activity
- Report sightings through secure channels
- Provide early warning to the community
- Respond to calls for help during enforcement encounters
- Document interactions (with consent)

**Never involved in**: Transportation, resource distribution, or knowing safe locations.

#### Training Requirement

**All Sentinels must be trained as constitutional observers before participating in any observation or response activities.**

Constitutional observer training covers:
- Legal rights during police/ICE encounters
- How to observe without interfering
- Documentation techniques (video, notes)
- De-escalation tactics
- When to call for legal support
- Personal safety protocols

::: tip TRAINING RESOURCES
Many organizations offer constitutional observer training, including the ACLU, National Lawyers Guild, and local immigrant rights groups. Complete training before your first observation shift.

#### Device Security for Sentinels

**Strongly recommended: Use a dedicated "burner" phone for observation and patrol activities.**

A burner phone is a separate, inexpensive device used only for Sentinel work, not connected to your personal identity or daily life.

**Why use a burner phone:**

| Risk | How Burner Phone Protects |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Device seizure** | If confiscated, contains no personal information or contacts |
| **Forced unlock** | Biometrics can be compelled without warrant in many jurisdictions |
| **Contact exposure** | Doesn't contain your personal contacts or family information |
| **Location tracking** | Can be left at home when not on duty, no location history |
| **Pattern analysis** | No connection to your daily movements or personal life |

**Burner Phone Setup:**

1. **Purchase with cash** at a retail store (not online)
2. **Use prepaid service** (no contract, no ID required)
3. **Set a strong PIN** (6+ digits, not your birthday or common numbers)
4. **Disable biometric unlock** (fingerprint, face recognition)
   - Biometrics can be compelled without a warrant in many jurisdictions
   - PINs have stronger legal protection (5th Amendment)
5. **Install only essential apps**: Signal, camera app
6. **Enable screen lock** with short timeout (30 seconds)
7. **Turn off cloud backups** and location services when not needed
8. **Use a generic lock screen** (no personal photos)

**Operational Use:**

- **Only carry during Sentinel activities**: Leave at home otherwise
- **Only communicate with other Sentinels**: Don't call personal contacts
- **Delete photos/videos after uploading** to secure storage
- **Power off when not in use**: Prevents location tracking
- **If stopped by law enforcement**: You are not required to unlock it
  - "I don't consent to searches" is sufficient
  - Do not use biometrics (they can force your finger/face)
  - PIN/passcode has stronger legal protection

**Cost Considerations:**

- Basic smartphone: $50-150 (one-time)
- Prepaid service: $15-40/month (only pay when active)
- Consider cell-wide fund to help members afford burner phones

::: warning LEGAL PROTECTION
In many jurisdictions, law enforcement can compel you to unlock a phone using biometrics (fingerprint, face) without a warrant, but they cannot compel you to reveal a PIN or passcode without additional legal process. **Always use PIN, never biometrics, on Sentinel devices.**
:::

**Alternative if burner phone isn't possible:**

If you must use your personal phone:
- Create a separate user profile (Android) or use guided access (iOS)
- Enable disappearing messages on all Signal conversations
- Delete observation photos immediately after sharing
- Be aware you have less protection if device is seized

#### Live Coordination During Active Observation

When Sentinels are actively observing or responding to an incident, coordination happens via **Signal voice calls**, not text:

**Why voice calls:**
- Real-time coordination without delay
- No text record of specific locations or actions
- Faster response in urgent situations
- Can communicate while moving

**Operational protocols:**
- **Wear earbuds**: Prevents bystanders from hearing coordination details
- **Use first names only**: No last names or identifying information
- **Keep calls brief**: Share essential information, then hang up
- **Mute when not speaking**: Reduces background noise and accidental audio

#### SALUTE Reporting Method

Sentinels use the **SALUTE** format to provide structured, actionable information to the group. This military-derived method ensures consistent, complete reporting without unnecessary details.

| Element | What to Report | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **S - Size** | Number of individuals, vehicles, or description of group | "2 vehicles, 4 individuals" |
| **A - Activity** | Specific actions being performed | "Taking photos of building entrance" |
| **L - Location** | Exact location using landmarks or cross-streets | "Northeast corner of 5th and Main" |
| **U - Uniform/Unit** | Clothing, patches, insignia, vehicle markings | "Dark blue jackets, unmarked white SUV" |
| **T - Time** | When the activity was observed | "0830 hours" or "8:30 AM" |
| **E - Equipment** | Tools, weapons, vehicles, cameras visible | "Cameras, radios, one vehicle has tinted windows" |

**How to use SALUTE:**

During voice calls or when reporting to the Sentinels group, structure your report using these elements. You don't need to say "S-A-L-U-T-E" — just provide the information in order.

**Example SALUTE report:**

> "Two unmarked vehicles, four individuals. They're photographing the front entrance and talking to someone in a parked car. Northeast corner of 5th and Main Street. All wearing dark clothing, no visible badges. Observed at 8:30 AM. Both vehicles are white SUVs with tinted windows, individuals have cameras and radios."

### Examples: Good vs. Bad Information

#### ✅ GOOD Information (Actionable, Secure)

**Example 1:**
> "Three vehicles, approximately 6 individuals. Conducting surveillance on the grocery store parking lot. Corner of Elm and 2nd Street. Plain clothes, one wearing a vest with 'POLICE' on back. Observed at 1:45 PM. Two sedans and one van, all unmarked."

**Why it's good:**
- Follows SALUTE structure
- Provides actionable details
- Uses landmarks, not exact addresses
- No names of community members
- Focuses on observable facts

**Example 2:**
> "Single vehicle, two occupants. Parked and observing foot traffic. West side of the community center, near the bus stop. Both in casual clothing, no visible identification. Observed at 9:15 AM. Dark sedan with government plates."

**Why it's good:**
- Clear, concise
- Location described by landmarks
- Observable details only
- No speculation about intent

**Example 3:**
> "Four individuals on foot. Approaching businesses and asking questions. Main Street between 3rd and 4th. Wearing jackets with 'ICE' visible. Observed at 11:00 AM. Carrying clipboards and radios."

**Why it's good:**
- Specific activity described
- Clear location boundaries
- Identifies visible agency markings
- Equipment noted

#### ❌ BAD Information (Insecure, Incomplete, or Dangerous)

**Example 1:**
> "ICE is at 1247 Maple Street where Maria lives. They're looking for her husband. She's scared and doesn't know what to do."

**Why it's bad:**
- ❌ Exact address in text form (creates permanent record)
- ❌ Names community members (exposes vulnerable people)
- ❌ Speculates about intent ("looking for her husband")
- ❌ No SALUTE structure (incomplete information)
- ❌ Emotional details instead of facts

**Example 2:**
> "Some guys are watching the area. Not sure how many. Somewhere on the east side. Saw them earlier."

**Why it's bad:**
- ❌ Vague and unactionable ("some guys," "somewhere")
- ❌ No time specified ("earlier" is not useful)
- ❌ No description of individuals or vehicles
- ❌ No specific location
- ❌ Missing most SALUTE elements

**Example 3:**
> "Two ICE vehicles at the apartment complex. They're definitely doing a raid. Everyone needs to hide. I think they're going to arrest people. This is bad."

**Why it's bad:**
- ❌ Speculation ("definitely doing a raid," "going to arrest")
- ❌ Creates panic instead of providing facts
- ❌ No specific location (which apartment complex?)
- ❌ No time, no description of activity
- ❌ Mixing observation with interpretation

**Example 4:**
> "Enforcement at the corner store. Same place we saw them last week. Remember when they arrested that guy? Probably the same team."

**Why it's bad:**
- ❌ References past activities (creates pattern record)
- ❌ Mentions previous arrest (connects incidents)
- ❌ Speculation about team identity
- ❌ Incomplete current observation

**Example 5:**
> "Suspicious activity at [exact GPS coordinates]. Target appears to be the business owner. Recommend immediate response."

**Why it's bad:**
- ❌ Uses military/law enforcement language ("target," "recommend response")
- ❌ GPS coordinates create precise digital record
- ❌ Identifies specific person as focus
- ❌ Sounds like operational planning (legal risk)

### Key Principles for Reporting

**DO:**
- ✓ Use SALUTE structure for completeness
- ✓ Report observable facts only
- ✓ Use landmarks and cross-streets for location
- ✓ Specify exact time of observation
- ✓ Describe what you see, not what you think it means
- ✓ Keep reports brief and actionable

**DON'T:**
- ✗ Name community members in reports
- ✗ Share exact addresses in text
- ✗ Speculate about intent or future actions
- ✗ Reference past incidents or patterns
- ✗ Use law enforcement jargon
- ✗ Create panic with emotional language
- ✗ Include information you didn't personally observe

::: tip REMEMBER
You are a witness, not an investigator. Report what you see, when you see it, where you see it. Let others decide what action to take based on your factual report.
:::

#### Documentation Protocol

When observing enforcement activity:

1. **Begin recording immediately** with your cell phone camera
2. **Film from a safe distance** (at least 10-15 feet)
3. **Announce you are recording** (in some jurisdictions this is required)
4. **Capture badge numbers and vehicle IDs** if visible
5. **Do not interfere** with the enforcement action
6. **Upload footage to secure storage** (not cloud services)
7. **Share with legal contacts** if community member requests support

::: warning LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
You have the right to record police and ICE in public spaces. However, do not physically interfere with their actions. Your role is to observe, document, and provide a witness presence.
:::

#### Alert Signals

Sentinels use audible warning signals to communicate without phones:

| Signal | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **3 short whistle bursts** | Warning / Suspicious activity | Unmarked vehicles, unusual surveillance, potential enforcement presence |
| **1 long whistle blast** | Emergency / Abduction in progress | Active arrest, someone being taken, immediate danger |

**Why whistles:**
- Audible over distance
- Doesn't require phone or line of sight
- Universally recognizable within the cell
- Can't be traced or intercepted

**Each Sentinel should carry a whistle** on their person during observation activities.

#### Deployment Models

Sentinels can operate in different configurations based on community needs:

**1. Dedicated Patrols (Stationary Observation)**

- **Purpose**: Monitor high-activity hotspots for suspicious activity
- **Locations**: Near immigrant-owned businesses, community centers, transit hubs, schools
- **Shift length**: 2-4 hours per observer
- **Team size**: 2-3 observers per location (for safety and corroboration)
- **Activities**: Watch for unmarked vehicles, unusual surveillance, enforcement patterns

**When to use**: High-risk areas with frequent enforcement activity, or during periods of heightened threat.

**2. Rapid Responders (Mobile Response)**

- **Purpose**: Stay mobile and respond to calls for help
- **Coverage**: Broader geographic area
- **Response time**: Aim for 10-15 minutes to reach any location in coverage area
- **Team size**: 2-person teams (driver + observer)
- **Activities**: Respond to community calls, provide witness presence, document encounters

**When to use**: Lower-density areas, or as backup to dedicated patrols.

**3. Hybrid Model**

- Some Sentinels on dedicated patrols at high-risk locations
- Other Sentinels on standby as rapid responders
- Coordination via Signal voice calls when response needed

**Most cells use a hybrid approach**, adapting based on current threat levels and available volunteers.

### Transporters

**Purpose**: Provide safe transportation to essential destinations.

**Activities**:
- Drive community members to work, medical appointments, grocery stores
- Pick up children from school when parents cannot
- Provide rides to legal appointments or court dates
- Deliver groceries and essential supplies
- Transport to safe locations when needed

**Never involved in**: Observation/sentinel activities, knowing safe house locations.

#### Operational Security: Address Handling Protocol

**Never share addresses in text form on Signal.** Text addresses create a permanent record that can be seized and used to map your network.

**The Photo Method:**

1. **Write the address on paper** (use a notepad, scrap paper, anything)
2. **Take a photo of the paper** with your phone
3. **Send the photo via Signal** to the driver
4. **Delete the photo immediately** after the ride is completed
5. **Recipient deletes the photo** after viewing and memorizing the address

**Why this works:**
- Photos can be set to disappear in Signal
- No searchable text record of addresses
- Harder to compile into a database if device is seized
- Driver memorizes the address, then it's gone

::: warning CRITICAL PROTOCOL
This is not optional. Text addresses create maps. Maps expose networks. Maps get people arrested. **Always use the photo method.**
:::

#### Dispatcher Model

Some cells use a **dispatcher** to coordinate rides without exposing operational details:

**How it works:**
1. Community member requests a ride (through trusted contact)
2. Dispatcher receives request and checks for available drivers
3. Dispatcher connects driver and rider via Signal introduction
4. **Dispatcher steps back** — they don't need to know pickup/dropoff details
5. Driver and rider coordinate directly using the photo method for addresses

**Benefits:**
- Dispatcher doesn't know specific locations (compartmentalization)
- Reduces dispatcher's exposure if compromised
- Scales better as the segment grows
- Driver and rider have direct communication

#### Use Cases

Transporters provide rides for essential activities that keep community members safe and functioning:

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Work transportation** | Daily rides to job sites, especially early morning or late night shifts |
| **Medical appointments** | Doctor visits, pharmacy pickups, emergency care |
| **Grocery shopping** | Weekly shopping trips, especially for families without vehicles |
| **School coordination** | Picking up children when parents can't, school events |
| **Legal appointments** | Immigration attorney meetings, court dates, check-ins |
| **Essential errands** | Bank visits, government offices, critical personal business |
| **Safe relocation** | Moving to temporary safe locations (without knowing the final destination) |

**What Transporters don't do:**
- They don't ask why someone needs a ride
- They don't keep records of rides given
- They don't share information about who they've driven
- They don't discuss routes or destinations with other segments

---

### Resource Network

**Purpose**: Collect and distribute supplies, funds, and essentials.

**Activities**:
- Organize food and supply drives
- Manage emergency funds for legal fees, rent, bail
- Coordinate with local mutual aid for material needs
- Distribute resources through trusted channels

**Never involved in**: Observation, transportation routes, or safe house locations.

---

### Business Allies

**Purpose**: Support and protect immigrant-owned businesses.

**Activities**:
- Patronize targeted businesses
- Provide presence during harassment incidents
- Organize community "buy-in" days
- De-escalation and witness presence

**Never involved in**: Sensitive operational activities in other segments.

---

### Legal Observers

**Purpose**: Train community on rights and connect to legal resources.

**Activities**:
- Conduct Know Your Rights trainings
- Provide legal observer presence at sensitive locations
- Connect community members with immigration attorneys
- Document rights violations (with consent)

**Role**: Legal observers may work across segments for training purposes, but do not participate in operational activities of other segments.

---

## Segment Isolation

This is the core security principle:

| Segment | Knows | Doesn't Know |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Sentinels | Observation protocols, reporting channels | Transportation routes, resource locations |
| Transporters | Pickup/dropoff points for their rides | Sentinel identities, safe houses |
| Resources | Distribution methods, supply sources | Member identities in other segments |
| Business Allies | Business locations, de-escalation tactics | Sensitive operational details |
| Legal Observers | Training content, legal contacts | Operational details of any segment |

**Why this matters**: If any one person is compromised — through arrest, coercion, or infiltration — they can only reveal what their segment knows. The rest of the network remains protected.

## Creating Segments

Not every cell needs every segment. Start with what your community needs most:

- High surveillance activity? → Start with **Sentinels**
- People afraid to leave home? → Start with **Transporters**
- Businesses being targeted? → Start with **Business Allies**
- People don't know their rights? → Start with **Legal Observers**

Add segments as capacity and need grows.

## Segment Size

**Guideline**: Keep segments to roughly 15 members or fewer. Larger groups:
- Are harder to coordinate
- Have weaker trust bonds
- Present greater risk if compromised

When a segment grows beyond this, consider:
- Adding co-leads
- Splitting by geography (East/West)
- Splitting by function (drivers vs. dispatchers)

This is guidance, not a rule. Each cell decides.
