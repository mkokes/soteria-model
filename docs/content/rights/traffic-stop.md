# During a Traffic Stop

Traffic stops can feel frightening. Knowing your rights helps you stay calm and protected.

## When You're Pulled Over

### Pull Over Safely

- Use your turn signal
- Pull to a safe location
- Turn off your engine
- Keep your hands visible on the steering wheel

### Stay Calm

- Do not make sudden movements
- Wait for the officer to approach
- Keep your hands visible at all times

## What You Must Provide

In most states, drivers must provide:

- **Driver's license**
- **Vehicle registration**
- **Proof of insurance**

Let the officer know before reaching for documents:

> "My documents are in [location]. I'm going to reach for them now."

## What You Don't Have to Answer

Beyond providing documents, you can remain silent:

> "I am exercising my right to remain silent."

You do not have to answer:
- Where you were born
- Where you're coming from or going to
- Your immigration status
- Questions about passengers

## For Passengers

Passengers have even fewer obligations:

- You may not have to identify yourself (varies by state)
- You can remain silent
- You can refuse consent to searches
- You can record the encounter

## Searches

### You Can Refuse Consent

> "I do not consent to a search."

If officers search anyway, do not physically resist, but clearly state:

> "I do not consent to this search."

### When They Can Search Without Consent

- If they see something illegal in plain view
- If they have probable cause to believe there's evidence of a crime
- If they arrest you
- If your car is impounded (inventory search)

## If Asked About Immigration Status

You can remain silent. If pressed, you can say:

> "I choose not to answer that question."

Do not lie — but you do not have to answer.

## If Immigration (ICE/CBP) Makes the Stop

The same rights apply:

- Provide driver's license, registration, insurance
- You can remain silent about immigration status
- Do not consent to searches
- Do not sign anything

::: warning BORDER PATROL CHECKPOINTS
Within 100 miles of borders, you may encounter checkpoints. You must stop, but you can still:
- Remain silent about immigration status
- Refuse consent to searches (though they may search anyway)
- Record the encounter
:::

## Document the Stop

After the stop, write down:

- Time and location
- Officer names and badge numbers
- What was said and done
- Witnesses present

## If You're Arrested

1. **Stay calm and do not resist**
2. **Say**: "I am exercising my right to remain silent. I want to speak with an attorney."
3. **Do not sign anything**
4. **Request a phone call** — contact your attorney or cell's legal support
5. **Remember**: You have the right to a bond hearing if detained

## Using the Transporter Segment

If you're concerned about traffic stops:

- Consider using your cell's Transporter segment for essential trips
- Transporters are trained on rights and de-escalation
- This is especially helpful for high-risk trips (court dates, work in certain areas)
