# Setting Up Signal

Signal is the recommended communication platform for Soteria cells. It provides end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, and is widely trusted by security professionals.

## Why Signal?

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| End-to-end encryption | Only sender and recipient can read messages |
| Open source | Code can be audited for security |
| Disappearing messages | Reduces data if device is seized |
| No message metadata stored | Signal doesn't keep logs of who you message |
| Screen security | Can prevent screenshots |
| Registration lock | Prevents SIM-swap attacks |

## Individual Setup

Every member should configure Signal properly:

### Step 1: Install Signal

Download only from official sources:
- [signal.org](https://signal.org/download/)
- Official app stores (iOS App Store, Google Play)

Never download from third-party sites.

### Step 2: Register

- Use a phone number you control
- Consider using a number not tied to your identity (prepaid, Google Voice)

### Step 2.5: Set Your Profile Name

**Do not use your real full name in Signal.**

When setting up your Signal profile:
- **Use first name only** (e.g., "Maria" not "Maria Rodriguez")
- **Use a nickname or alias** (e.g., "Jay" instead of "James")
- **Use initials** (e.g., "MK" instead of "Michael Kim")
- **Never use full legal name** (creates unnecessary exposure if device seized)

**Why this matters:**
- If your phone is seized, your Signal contacts list becomes a membership roster
- Real names make it easier to identify and target members
- Reduces exposure if screenshots or device access occurs
- First names or aliases provide enough identification within trusted groups

::: warning IDENTITY PROTECTION
Your Signal profile name is visible to everyone in your groups. Assume it could be seen by law enforcement if any device in the group is compromised. **Never use your full legal name.**
:::

### Step 3: Configure Security Settings

Open Signal Settings and configure:

**Privacy Settings:**
- [x] Screen Lock: ON (with PIN or biometric)
- [x] Screen Security: ON (prevents screenshots)
- [x] Registration Lock: ON (prevents SIM-swap hijacking)
- [x] Always Relay Calls: Consider ON (hides IP address)

**Chat Settings:**
- [x] Default Disappearing Messages: 1 week (or shorter for sensitive groups)

### Step 4: Verify Safety Numbers

When communicating with other cell members, verify safety numbers:
1. Open conversation
2. Tap contact name at top
3. Tap "View Safety Number"
4. Compare numbers in person or via video call

This confirms you're talking to the right person, not an impersonator.

## Group Structure

### Recommended Groups

Create separate groups for each segment and function:

```
Cell Groups
├── Stewards Coordination (founders + stewards only)
├── Sentinels Segment
├── Transporters Segment
├── Resources Segment
├── Business Allies Segment
├── Legal Observers Segment
└── Announcements (one-way, cell-wide)
```

**Critical Rule: One Person, One Segment Group**

Each member should only be in:
1. Their assigned segment group (Sentinels, Transporters, etc.)
2. The cell-wide Announcements group (if your cell uses one)

**Never add someone to multiple segment groups.** This breaks compartmentalization and creates security vulnerabilities.

### Vetting Before Adding to Groups

Before adding anyone to a segment group, verify:

- [ ] They have been vouched for by a trusted member
- [ ] They have completed the onboarding process
- [ ] They have been assigned to this specific segment
- [ ] They understand compartmentalization and the "one segment" rule
- [ ] Their Signal is properly configured (disappearing messages, screen lock, etc.)

**If any of these are not complete, do not add them to the group.**

### Group Naming

**Don't use obvious names.** Instead of "Austin Soteria Transporters," use:
- Neutral code names
- Unrelated themes (book clubs, sports teams, hobby groups)
- Numbers or letters

Agree on naming convention within your cell.

### Group Settings

For each group:
- **Disappearing messages**: ON (1 week or less)
- **Group link**: OFF (prevents joining without admin approval)
- **Add members**: Admin-only
- **Edit group info**: Admin-only

### Admin Practices

Group admins are **stewards of security**, not just coordinators. Admin responsibilities include:

**Membership Management:**
- **Vet before adding**: Only add members who have been properly vouched for and completed onboarding for that specific segment
- **One segment per person**: Never add someone to multiple segment groups. Compartmentalization requires each person to be in ONE segment only
- **Prompt removal**: Remove members immediately when they leave the cell or change segments
- **Regular reviews**: Monthly review of group membership to ensure everyone should still have access

**Security Protocols:**
- **At least 2 admins per group**: Ensures continuity if one admin is unavailable or compromised
- **Admin devices must have highest security**: Screen locks, disappearing messages, registration locks all enabled
- **No screenshots**: Remind members that screen security should be enabled
- **Monitor for security violations**: Watch for members sharing information across segments or discussing sensitive details
- **Verify profile names**: Ensure members are not using full legal names in their Signal profiles
  - If someone joins with a full name, privately ask them to change it to first name or alias only
  - Explain the security rationale: seized devices create membership rosters

**Group Hygiene:**
- **Audit membership quarterly**: Verify every member is still active and properly vetted
- **Document nothing**: Don't keep lists of who was added when or why they left
- **Trust your instincts**: If something feels off about a member, discuss with other stewards

::: warning ADMIN RESPONSIBILITY
As a group admin, you hold the keys to your segment's security. A compromised admin account or a careless addition can expose the entire segment. Take this role seriously.

## Communication Protocols

### What to Discuss on Signal

- Coordination and logistics
- Scheduling
- General updates
- Training information

### What NOT to Discuss on Signal

Even with encryption, be cautious about:
- Specific locations of vulnerable individuals
- Detailed personal information
- Anything that would be damaging if read by authorities
- Names of undocumented community members

**Assume messages could be compromised.** Encryption protects transit — not a seized device.

### Code Words (Optional)

Some cells develop code words for common situations:
- "The weather is changing" = enforcement activity observed
- "Book club is cancelled" = stand down, security concern
- "Need a recipe" = requesting transportation

Keep code systems simple. Complex codes get forgotten.
