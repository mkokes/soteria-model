# Start a Cell

Ready to bring the Soteria Model to your community? This guide walks you through the process.

## Before You Begin

### Is a Cell Right for Your Community?

A cell makes sense when:
- There is a vulnerable population facing real threats
- There are trusted people willing to commit long-term
- You have at least 3-5 founding members who deeply trust each other
- You're prepared for the security responsibilities

### Alternatives to Consider

Not every community needs a full cell structure:

- **Informal mutual aid**: Neighbors helping neighbors without formal structure
- **Existing organizations**: Partner with immigrant rights groups, churches, unions
- **Know Your Rights only**: Start with education before building infrastructure

## The Founding Team

A cell begins with a **founding team** of 3-5 people who:

1. **Know each other deeply** — years of relationship, not months
2. **Share values** — committed to the [Core Principles](/model/principles)
3. **Have capacity** — time and energy for ongoing commitment
4. **Bring diverse skills** — organizing, logistics, legal knowledge, community connections
5. **Can keep information secure** — understand OpSec and practice it

::: tip START SMALL
It's better to start with 3 deeply trusted people than 10 acquaintances. Trust is your foundation.

## Startup Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] Founding team agrees on commitment and principles
- [ ] All members complete [security training](/security/)
- [ ] Set up initial Signal infrastructure ([guide](/start-a-cell/signal-setup))
- [ ] Define initial segments based on community needs
- [ ] Establish onboarding process

### Phase 2: First Members

- [ ] Each founder vouches for 1-2 trusted people
- [ ] New members go through onboarding process
- [ ] Assign members to segments
- [ ] Begin low-risk activities (Know Your Rights training, business support)
- [ ] Test communication and coordination

### Phase 3: Operations

- [ ] Activate segments based on community needs
- [ ] Continue careful vouching and growth
- [ ] Regular security practice review
- [ ] Adapt structure as you learn

## What Segments to Start

You don't need every segment immediately. Start with what your community needs most:

| Community Need | Suggested First Segment |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Fear of going to work, errands | **Transporters** |
| ICE activity observed | **Sentinels** |
| People don't know their rights | **Legal Observers** |
| Businesses being targeted | **Business Allies** |
| General material needs | **Resource Network** |

Add segments as capacity and need grows.

## Your First Activities

Start with lower-risk activities to build trust and practice:

- **Know Your Rights trainings** (community education)
- **Business support days** (organized patronage)
- **Supply drives** (material mutual aid)
- **Check-in systems** (simple accountability)

As trust and coordination strengthen, take on more sensitive activities.

## Common Mistakes

### Growing Too Fast

Pressure to help everyone can lead to vouching people you don't truly trust. Resist this.

### Too Much Structure

Don't create infrastructure you don't need yet. Structure should follow need.

### Poor Communication Security

Assuming everyone knows OpSec. Train everyone, repeatedly.

### Single Points of Failure

If one person knows everything, the cell is vulnerable. Distribute knowledge.

### Burnout

This is a marathon. Pace yourselves. Build in rest.
