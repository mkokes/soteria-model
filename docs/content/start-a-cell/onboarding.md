## Step 1: Vouching

### Voucher Responsibilities

When you vouch for someone, you're saying:
- I know this person well and trust them
- I believe they share our values
- I take responsibility for their integration
- I will mentor them through onboarding

### Before Vouching, Ask Yourself

- How long have I known this person?
- Have I seen them keep confidences?
- Do they understand the stakes?
- Would I trust them with sensitive information today?
- Am I vouching because I truly trust them, or because we need people?

### Contacting the Onboarding Steward

When ready to vouch:
1. Contact the Onboarding Steward via secure channel
2. Provide: Your name, prospect's first name, how you know them, why you trust them
3. Schedule an initial conversation

## Step 2: Initial Conversation

### Who Attends
- Onboarding Steward
- The prospect
- The voucher

### Purpose
This is not an interview or interrogation. It's a conversation to:
- Get to know each other
- Explain what participation involves
- Assess mutual fit
- Answer questions honestly

### Topics to Cover

**About the cell:**
- What we do and why
- The commitment involved
- Security expectations

**About the prospect:**
- Why are they interested?
- What capacity do they have?
- What skills/connections do they bring?
- Understanding of risks involved

**About expectations:**
- Probationary period and what it means
- Segment assignment
- Ongoing security practices

### Red Flags

- Rushing to join quickly
- Dismissive of security practices
- Asking for lots of details before joining
- Voucher seems hesitant or uncertain
- Prospect is unknown to others in the network

**Trust your instincts.** It's okay to say "not yet."

## Step 3: Security Training

Before joining any segment, every new member must complete security training:

### Required Topics

- [ ] Signal setup and configuration
- [ ] Device security basics
- [ ] What to share and not share
- [ ] Compartmentalization — why it matters
- [ ] What to do if approached by law enforcement
- [ ] Compromise protocol — what to do if you suspect a breach

### Training Format

Options:
- One-on-one with Onboarding Steward or voucher
- Small group training with multiple new members
- Self-study with verification (less ideal)

**Hands-on is best.** Actually set up Signal together.

## Step 4: Probationary Period

### Duration
Typically 2-3 months, but can vary based on:
- Cell's assessment of the person
- Pace of activities
- Level of trust development

### What Happens
- Assigned to one segment only
- Participates in lower-risk activities
- Voucher and segment lead observe
- Regular check-ins

### Activities During Probation
- Business patronage
- Supply sorting
- Attending Know Your Rights trainings (as participant)
- Simple logistics support

### Evaluation Points
- Do they follow security practices consistently?
- Do they show up reliably?
- Do they respect boundaries?
- Do they ask appropriate questions (curious but not prying)?

## Step 5: Trusted Status

### Confirmation
At end of probationary period:
1. Segment lead assesses readiness
2. Consults with voucher
3. If affirmed, member becomes Trusted

### What Changes
- Full participation in their segment
- Access to more sensitive activities
- After 3-6 months, can vouch for new members

### If Not Ready
If someone isn't ready for trusted status:
- Extend probation with clear goals
- Have honest conversation about concerns
- In rare cases, part ways gracefully
