# Founding Team

The founding team sets the culture, security practices, and trust foundation for your entire cell. Choose carefully and build intentionally.

## Who Should Be on the Founding Team?

### Essential Qualities

**Deep mutual trust**
- You've known each other for years, not months
- You've seen each other under stress
- You would trust them with sensitive information today

**Shared values**
- Committed to protecting vulnerable community members
- Understanding of why security practices matter
- Alignment on principles (even if tactics differ)

**Capacity**
- Time to commit — this is ongoing work
- Emotional capacity — this work is heavy
- Stability — not in personal crisis right now

**Security mindset**
- Willing to change habits for security
- Not prone to oversharing
- Takes digital security seriously

### Helpful (Not Required) Qualities

- Connections to the community you'll serve
- Organizing or logistics experience
- Legal knowledge or connections
- Technical skills (for communication infrastructure)
- Multiple languages

## How Many Founders?

**Minimum: 3 people**
- Enough for redundancy
- No single point of failure
- Can make decisions when one is unavailable

**Ideal: 4-5 people**
- Distributed workload
- Multiple perspectives
- Room for different strengths

**Maximum: 7 people**
- More than this becomes unwieldy for founding phase
- Others can join as first members after foundation is set

## Founding Team Commitments

Before starting, all founders should explicitly agree to:

1. **Confidentiality**: What's discussed stays within the team
2. **Security practices**: Follow all OpSec requirements without exception
3. **Time commitment**: Be available for initial setup (heavier) and ongoing coordination
4. **Conflict resolution**: How will you handle disagreements?
5. **Exit process**: What happens if someone needs to leave?

## First Founding Meeting

Your first meeting should:

### 1. Confirm Commitment
Go around: Is everyone ready for this? Any reservations?

### 2. Review Core Principles
Read through [Core Principles](/model/principles) together. Discuss any questions.

### 3. Complete Security Training Together
Go through [Security Handbook](/security/) as a group. Set up Signal together.

### 4. Assess Community Needs
- What threats is the community facing?
- What's most urgently needed?
- What capacity exists already?

### 5. Define Initial Structure
- Which segments to start?
- Who takes which steward roles initially?
- How will you communicate?

### 6. Set Next Steps
- When do you meet again?
- What does each person do before then?
- When do you start vouching in new members?

## Distributing Steward Roles

Initially, founders will hold all steward roles. Distribute based on strengths:

| Role | Good Fit For |
|------|--------------|
| Segment Lead | Organized, good with people, can manage logistics |
| Onboarding Steward | Good judge of character, patient, security-minded |
| Communications Steward | Technical skills, detail-oriented, security-focused |
| Logistics Coordinator | Systems thinker, can see big picture, organized |

One person may hold multiple roles at first. **Plan to distribute as you grow.**

## Founder Agreements Template

Consider documenting:

- Our shared principles
- Our commitment to security practices
- How we make decisions (consensus? majority?)
- How we handle conflicts
- How we handle a founder leaving
- How we handle a security breach
- When and how we meet

This doesn't need to be formal — but explicit agreement prevents problems later.

## Red Flags in Potential Founders

Do not include someone who:

- You've only known a short time
- Has a history of breaking confidences
- Is dismissive of security practices
- Is seeking a leadership position
- Is in active crisis (they should be supported, not founding)
- Makes you hesitate when you imagine trusting them fully

**Trust your gut.** If something feels off, it probably is.
