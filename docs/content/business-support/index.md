# Support Local Businesses

Immigrant-owned businesses are the backbone of our communities. When they're targeted for harassment, we stand with them. When they thrive, we all thrive.

## Why Business Support Matters

- **Economic solidarity**: Your dollars directly support families in our community
- **Visible presence**: A busy business is a protected business
- **Community strength**: Thriving businesses create thriving neighborhoods
- **Resistance**: Choosing where to spend is a form of mutual aid

## Ways to Support

### 🛒 Shop & Patronize

The simplest and most powerful action: **spend money at immigrant-owned businesses**.

- Make them your regular stops for groceries, restaurants, services
- Bring friends and family
- Leave positive reviews online

### 👥 Presence & Witness

If a business is being harassed:

- **Show up**: A crowd of supporters deters harassment
- **Witness**: Document incidents (with consent)
- **De-escalate**: Stay calm, don't engage with harassers
- **Report**: Let the Business Allies segment know

### 📣 Amplify

- Share their business on social media
- Recommend them to friends
- Write positive reviews on Google, Yelp
- Feature them in community newsletters

### 🤝 Organize Buy-In Days

Coordinate community-wide days to support specific businesses:
- Pick a day and a business
- Spread the word through community networks
- Show up together

## Collecting Business Information

If your cell wants to maintain a list of businesses that need support, **create your own secure intake form** rather than using a public or permanent system.

### Recommended: Create a Form with CryptPad

**CryptPad** is a zero-knowledge encrypted collaboration platform that's ideal for collecting sensitive information like business details.

**Why CryptPad:**
- ✓ Zero-knowledge encryption (even CryptPad can't read your data)
- ✓ No account required to create forms
- ✓ Can set forms to self-destruct after a time period
- ✓ Responses are encrypted and only accessible to form creator
- ✓ Can be shared via link with your community

**How to create a business intake form:**

1. Go to [CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) (or your preferred CryptPad instance)
2. Click "Form" to create a new form
3. Add fields to collect the information you need (see suggested fields below)
4. Enable "Self-destructing pad" if you want the form to auto-delete after a set time
5. Share the form link only through trusted channels (Signal groups, in-person)
6. Review responses regularly and transfer to your local records
7. Delete the form when no longer needed

**Suggested fields for your form:**
- Business name
- Type of business (restaurant, grocery, retail, service, etc.)
- Neighborhood/area
- Current situation (general support, experiencing harassment, struggling economically, new business)
- Contact name
- Preferred contact method (Signal, phone, in-person)
- Contact information
- Additional notes

::: warning SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
- **Don't leave forms open indefinitely** - Set a time limit or close after collecting responses
- **Don't link forms to personal accounts** - Use CryptPad anonymously
- **Share links carefully** - Only through encrypted channels like Signal
- **Transfer and delete** - Move information to your local records and delete the form
- **Consider sensitivity** - Business information could put owners at risk if exposed
:::

### Alternative: Direct Outreach

Instead of a form, Business Allies can:
- Visit businesses in person to introduce the cell
- Collect information through Signal conversations
- Build relationships through regular patronage
- Let business owners reach out when they need support

**This approach:**
- Creates no permanent digital record
- Builds trust through personal connection
- Allows business owners to control what information they share
- Reduces risk of information exposure
