# Communication OpSec

How you communicate is as important as what you communicate. This guide covers secure communication practices.

## Signal: The Primary Channel

All cell communication happens on Signal. Not text messages. Not WhatsApp. Not email. Signal.

### Why Only Signal?

| Platform | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| SMS/Text | Not encrypted, stored by carrier |
| WhatsApp | Owned by Meta, metadata collected |
| Telegram | Not encrypted by default |
| Email | Not encrypted, stored on servers |
| Social media DMs | Monitored, stored, often compelled |

Signal provides end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, and minimal metadata retention.

### When Signal Isn't Available

If you must communicate outside Signal:
- Keep it vague and brief
- Don't mention the cell, activities, or members
- Move to Signal as soon as possible
- Consider a phone call (still vulnerable, but less permanent than text)

## What to Communicate — and What Not To

### Safe to Discuss

- Meeting times and general logistics
- General updates and check-ins
- Training information
- Public know-your-rights information
- Resource needs (generally, not specific individuals)

### Never Discuss

Even on Signal, avoid:

| Topic | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Specific names of community members receiving help | Protects them if device seized |
| Detailed locations (addresses, safe houses) | Location information is high-risk |
| Future enforcement information | Could be misconstrued as conspiracy |
| Other segments' activities | Compartmentalization |
| Photographs of activities or people | Visual evidence persists |

### The Test

Before sending, ask:
> "If this message were read by ICE, would it put anyone at risk?"

If yes, don't send it — or rephrase.

## Disappearing Messages

All cell conversations should have disappearing messages enabled:

| Context | Recommended Timer |
|---------|------------------|
| Day-to-day coordination | 1 week |
| Sensitive discussions | 1 day |
| Highly sensitive | 1 hour |
| Announcements | 1 week - 1 month |

Messages that disappear can't be used against you.

## Voice and Video Calls

Signal also provides encrypted calls:

- Use for sensitive discussions not appropriate for text
- Enable "Always Relay Calls" to hide your IP address
- Still be cautious — you're speaking aloud, can be overheard

## Group Communication

### Identity Protection in Groups

**Do not use real full names in Signal groups.**

Every member in a Signal group can see:
- Profile names of all members
- Phone numbers (if not hidden in privacy settings)
- When you're online (if not disabled)

**If any device in the group is seized or compromised, that information becomes a membership list.**

**Safe naming practices:**
- ✓ First names only ("Maria," "James")
- ✓ Nicknames or aliases ("Jay," "Alex")
- ✓ Initials ("MK," "TR")
- ✗ Full legal names ("Maria Rodriguez," "James Thompson")
- ✗ Names that identify profession or role ("Officer Mike," "Attorney Sarah")

**Additional privacy settings:**
- Hide your phone number from non-contacts (Signal Settings → Privacy → Phone Number → Nobody)
- Disable "Read Receipts" and "Typing Indicators" (reduces metadata)
- Use a profile picture that doesn't identify you (or no picture)

::: warning MEMBERSHIP LISTS ARE DANGEROUS
A Signal group with everyone's real names is a ready-made membership roster for law enforcement. Protect your fellow members by protecting your own identity. **First names or aliases only.**
:::

### Group Hygiene

Proper group management is critical to maintaining compartmentalization and security:

**Membership Management:**
- **Remove members promptly when they leave**: Don't wait. Remove them the same day if possible
- **Review membership regularly**: Monthly audits to ensure everyone should still have access
- **Vet before adding**: Only add members who have completed onboarding for that specific segment
- **One segment per person**: Never add someone to multiple segment groups
- **Admins should be stewards**: Group admins hold security responsibility, not just coordination

**Segment Isolation in Groups:**
- Each segment has its own Signal group
- Members are only in their assigned segment group
- No cross-posting between segment groups
- No discussing other segments' activities in your group

::: danger COMPARTMENTALIZATION IN PRACTICE
If you're in the Transporters group, you should never see messages about Sentinel observations. If you're in the Sentinels group, you should never see messages about transportation routes. **Separate groups = separate knowledge = security.**
:::

### One-Way Announcements

For cell-wide announcements:
- Consider a separate "announcements" group
- Only admins can post
- Reduces noise and potential for mistakes

### Reply Carefully

In group chats:
- Don't quote-reply messages that should have disappeared
- Don't forward messages between groups
- Be aware that everyone in the group sees your message

## Metadata Considerations

Even with encryption, some information is visible:

| Metadata | Visibility |
|----------|------------|
| Who you're messaging | Your phone, their phone |
| When you're messaging | Signal servers (briefly) |
| How often you message | Your phone |
| Group membership | Group members |

Signal minimizes metadata collection, but it's not zero. Consider:
- Your phone's screen lock (prevents casual access)
- Who might look at your phone (family, employer, police)

## In-Person Communication

Sometimes the most secure channel is no channel:

- Sensitive decisions should happen in person when possible
- No devices present (or in another room)
- No notes taken
- Agreed summary shared afterward if needed

## Media and Public Communication

**General Policy: Do not speak to media about the cell.**

All cell members should refrain from speaking to media about the cell, its structure, activities, or members. This protects operational security and the safety of vulnerable community members.

### Why Media Silence Matters

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Operational exposure** | Describing how the cell works helps authorities understand and counter it |
| **Member identification** | Even vague descriptions can help identify participants |
| **Community member exposure** | Discussing who you help puts vulnerable people at risk |
| **Legal liability** | Public statements can be used as evidence in investigations |
| **Infiltration opportunities** | Media coverage attracts attention from those who want to disrupt |

### If Approached by Media

When a reporter, journalist, or media outlet contacts you:

**DO:**
- ✓ **Decline to comment** on cell operations, membership, or specific activities
- ✓ **Redirect to the broader issue**: Describe what enforcement agencies are doing and what rights/laws are being violated
- ✓ **Speak about publicly known information**: General community concerns, legal rights, public resources
- ✓ **Refer them to public resources**: ACLU, National Lawyers Guild, immigrant rights organizations
- ✓ **Be polite but firm**: "I can't speak to that, but I can tell you about the broader concerns in our community"

**DON'T:**
- ✗ Identify yourself as part of the network
- ✗ Name other members or describe roles
- ✗ Discuss specific cases or individuals being helped
- ✗ Describe operational details (how you coordinate, where you meet, what tools you use)
- ✗ Confirm or deny the existence of specific activities
- ✗ Provide photos or videos that show members or activities

### Safe vs. Unsafe Media Responses

#### ❌ UNSAFE Response Examples

**Reporter**: "Are you part of the community network helping undocumented immigrants?"

**Bad Answer**: "Yes, I'm a driver for the transportation team. We've given over 50 rides this month to help people get to work safely."

**Why it's bad**:
- ✗ Confirms membership
- ✗ Describes specific role
- ✗ Provides operational metrics
- ✗ Confirms specific activities

---

**Reporter**: "How does your group coordinate when ICE is in the area?"

**Bad Answer**: "We use Signal groups to alert each other. We have observers who watch for unmarked vehicles and then notify drivers to avoid those areas."

**Why it's bad**:
- ✗ Describes communication methods
- ✗ Reveals organizational structure
- ✗ Explains operational tactics
- ✗ Confirms coordination between segments

---

**Reporter**: "Can you tell me about someone you've helped?"

**Bad Answer**: "Last week we helped a family whose father was detained. We drove the mother to the detention center and helped them find a lawyer."

**Why it's bad**:
- ✗ Discusses specific case
- ✗ Provides timeline
- ✗ Describes specific assistance
- ✗ Could help identify the family

#### ✅ SAFE Response Examples

**Reporter**: "Are you part of the community network helping undocumented immigrants?"

**Good Answer**: "I can't speak to any specific organizations, but I can tell you that our community is deeply concerned about the increase in enforcement activity. Families are afraid to go to work, take their kids to school, or even buy groceries. That's a human rights issue that affects everyone."

**Why it's good**:
- ✓ Doesn't confirm or deny membership
- ✓ Redirects to broader community concerns
- ✓ Focuses on the problem, not the response
- ✓ Speaks to publicly observable issues

---

**Reporter**: "How does your group coordinate when ICE is in the area?"

**Good Answer**: "I can't comment on any specific coordination efforts. What I can tell you is that ICE's tactics of using unmarked vehicles and conducting surveillance in residential neighborhoods creates a climate of fear. People have a right to know when law enforcement is in their community, and they have a right to observe and document enforcement actions in public spaces."

**Why it's good**:
- ✓ Declines to discuss operations
- ✓ Redirects to enforcement agency tactics
- ✓ Frames issue as rights violation
- ✓ Speaks to legal principles, not specific actions

---

**Reporter**: "Can you tell me about someone you've helped?"

**Good Answer**: "I can't discuss any specific individuals or cases—that would put vulnerable people at risk. What I can tell you is that families in our community are living in fear. Parents are afraid to drive their kids to school. People are missing medical appointments because they're afraid to leave their homes. That's the reality of what's happening here."

**Why it's good**:
- ✓ Protects individual privacy
- ✓ Explains why you can't share details
- ✓ Redirects to community-wide impact
- ✓ Focuses on the problem, not specific solutions

---

**Reporter**: "Who leads your organization?"

**Good Answer**: "I'm not going to discuss any organizational structure. What you should be asking is why enforcement agencies are targeting immigrant communities with such aggressive tactics, and what that means for civil rights in our city."

**Why it's good**:
- ✓ Firm refusal to discuss structure
- ✓ Redirects to the real story
- ✓ Reframes the narrative
- ✓ No operational information revealed

### Who Can Speak Publicly

**Only designated cell stewards who have been trained in media interaction should consider public statements.**

Before any steward speaks publicly:
1. **Consult with the full steward group**: Collective decision, not individual choice
2. **Assess the risk**: What could be exposed? Who could be endangered?
3. **Prepare talking points**: Focus on community concerns, not cell operations
4. **Practice responses**: Anticipate questions and practice redirecting
5. **Consider alternatives**: Could a community organization speak instead?

**Even designated spokespeople should:**
- Never confirm cell structure or operations
- Never name members or describe roles
- Never discuss specific cases or individuals
- Focus on community impact and rights violations
- Redirect operational questions to broader issues

### Alternative Approaches

Instead of speaking to media directly, consider:

**1. Support existing advocacy organizations**
- Let established immigrant rights groups be the public voice
- They have legal protection and media training
- They can speak to broader issues without exposing your cell

**2. Anonymous community statements**
- Written statements from "concerned community members"
- No attribution to specific organizations
- Focus on observable facts and community impact

**3. Know Your Rights campaigns**
- Public education doesn't require discussing your cell
- Distribute rights information through community channels
- Let the information speak for itself

### Social Media

### Personal Accounts

- Don't discuss cell activities
- Don't post about activities, locations, or members
- Don't identify yourself as part of the network
- Be aware that your associations are visible

### Cell Social Media

Generally, cells should not have public social media. If you do:
- Never mention specific activities
- Never post photos that identify people
- Keep it to general know-your-rights information
- Have a policy for what can be posted

::: danger REMEMBER
Every public statement is permanent. Every interview can be subpoenaed. Every photo can be analyzed. **The safest approach is silence about operations and focus on the broader issue of community safety and civil rights.**
