# Security Handbook

Security isn't optional — it's how we protect each other. This handbook covers the essential practices every participant must follow.

## Why Security Matters

The people we protect face real consequences if exposed:
- Detention and deportation
- Family separation
- Job loss
- Harassment and violence

Our security practices exist to prevent these outcomes. When we take security seriously, we protect our most vulnerable community members.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Assume Compromise is Possible

No system is perfectly secure. We design our structure so that when (not if) something goes wrong, the damage is contained.

### 2. Minimize What You Know

You can't reveal what you don't know. This is why we compartmentalize.

### 3. Minimize What You Store

Data that doesn't exist can't be seized. We use disappearing messages and avoid records.

### 4. Practice Consistently

Security only works if everyone does it, every time. One slip can compromise others.

Each layer reinforces the others. Weakness in one can be compensated by strength in others — but all matter.

## Minimum Requirements for All Participants

Every person in the network must:

- [ ] Use Signal for all cell communication
- [ ] Configure disappearing messages
- [ ] Lock their phone with PIN/biometric
- [ ] Never discuss cell activities on other platforms
- [ ] Never share information across segments
- [ ] Complete security training before participating

These are not suggestions. They are requirements.
