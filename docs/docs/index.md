## What is the Soteria Model?

**Soteria** — from the Greek goddess of safety and deliverance — is a framework for communities to organize mutual aid and protection for vulnerable populations, particularly immigrants facing harassment, surveillance, or targeting.

This is not a service. It's a **blueprint**. A set of principles, structures, and practices that any community can adopt to protect their own.

### The Problem

Immigrant communities — documented, undocumented, and citizens targeted by the color of their skin — face increasing threats during daily life: going to work, buying groceries, visiting the laundromat. Immigrant-owned businesses face harassment. Families live in fear.

### The Solution

Organized community protection through:

- **Sentinels** who observe and report suspicious activity
- **Transporters** who provide safe rides to essential destinations
- **Resource networks** that distribute supplies and funds
- **Business allies** who support and protect immigrant-owned businesses
- **Legal observers** who train community members on their rights

All coordinated through **encrypted communication**, organized in **isolated segments** for security, and connected through a **web of trust** built on personal vouching.

### Core Principles

1. **Compartmentalization** — Segments don't overlap. Someone doing observation never knows transportation routes.
2. **Vouching** — Every member is personally vouched for by someone trusted. No open recruitment.
3. **Autonomy** — Each cell operates independently. No central authority to compromise.
4. **Privacy** — No databases of vulnerable individuals. No tracking. Coordination happens off-platform.
5. **Replicability** — This model is designed to be copied. Take it. Adapt it. Protect your community.
