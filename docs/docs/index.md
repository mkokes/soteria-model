## What is the Soteria Model?

<p class="lead">
<strong>Soteria</strong> — from the Greek goddess of safety and deliverance — is a framework for communities to organize mutual aid and protection for vulnerable populations, particularly immigrants facing harassment, surveillance, or targeting.
</p>

<p class="lead">
This is not a service. It's a <strong>blueprint</strong>. A set of principles, structures, and practices that any community can adopt to protect their own.
</p>

<div class="section-divider"></div>

### The Problem

Immigrant communities — documented, undocumented, and citizens targeted by the color of their skin — face increasing threats during daily life: going to work, buying groceries, visiting the laundromat. Immigrant-owned businesses face harassment. Families live in fear.

### The Solution

Organized community protection through:

<div class="solution-grid">

<div class="solution-item">
  <strong>Sentinels</strong> who observe and report suspicious activity
</div>

<div class="solution-item">
  <strong>Transporters</strong> who provide safe rides to essential destinations
</div>

<div class="solution-item">
  <strong>Resource networks</strong> that distribute supplies and funds
</div>

<div class="solution-item">
  <strong>Business allies</strong> who support and protect immigrant-owned businesses
</div>

<div class="solution-item">
  <strong>Legal observers</strong> who train community members on their rights
</div>

</div>

<p class="coordination-note">
All coordinated through <strong>encrypted communication</strong>, organized in <strong>isolated segments</strong> for security, and connected through a <strong>web of trust</strong> built on personal vouching.
</p>

<div class="section-divider"></div>

### Core Principles

<div class="principles-list">

<div class="principle-item">
  <span class="principle-number">1</span>
  <div class="principle-content">
    <strong>Compartmentalization</strong> — Segments don't overlap. Someone doing observation never knows transportation routes.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-item">
  <span class="principle-number">2</span>
  <div class="principle-content">
    <strong>Vouching</strong> — Every member is personally vouched for by someone trusted. No open recruitment.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-item">
  <span class="principle-number">3</span>
  <div class="principle-content">
    <strong>Autonomy</strong> — Each cell operates independently. No central authority to compromise.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-item">
  <span class="principle-number">4</span>
  <div class="principle-content">
    <strong>Privacy</strong> — No databases of vulnerable individuals. No tracking. Coordination happens off-platform.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-item">
  <span class="principle-number">5</span>
  <div class="principle-content">
    <strong>Replicability</strong> — This model is designed to be copied. Take it. Adapt it. Protect your community.
