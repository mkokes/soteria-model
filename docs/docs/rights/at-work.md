# At Work

Workers have rights — even during workplace raids. Knowing these rights can protect you and your coworkers.

## If Immigration Arrives at Your Workplace

### Do Not Run

Running can be dangerous and may be used against you. Stay calm.

### Remain Silent

> "I am exercising my right to remain silent."

You do not have to answer questions about your immigration status — even at work.

### Ask if You Are Free to Leave

> "Am I free to leave?"

If the answer is yes, leave calmly. If no, you are being detained.

### Ask for a Warrant

Officers need a judicial warrant to enter non-public areas of a workplace. Ask:

> "Do you have a judicial warrant?"

An ICE administrative warrant is not enough to enter private workspaces.

## Types of Workplace Operations

### I-9 Audit

- ICE requests employment records from employer
- You may not be present when this happens
- Employer should notify workers and allow time to correct records
- You have the right to consult an attorney

### Targeted Enforcement

- ICE comes for specific individuals
- Other workers should continue working
- Do not volunteer information about coworkers

### Workplace Raid

- ICE enters the workplace
- Stay calm, do not run
- Exercise your right to silence
- Do not sign anything

## Worker Rights During Enforcement

Even during enforcement actions, you have rights:

| Right | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| Remain silent | You don't have to answer questions |
| Attorney | You can request a lawyer before speaking |
| Don't sign | Never sign documents you don't understand |
| Phone call | If detained, you have the right to make calls |
| Personal belongings | You can take your belongings when leaving |

## What Employers Can and Cannot Do

### Employers Can:
- Comply with valid warrants
- Provide records under proper legal process
- Allow access to public areas

### Employers Cannot:
- Force you to speak with ICE
- Retaliate against you for exercising rights
- Discriminate based on perceived immigration status
- Provide records without proper legal process

## Preparing Your Workplace

### Talk to Your Coworkers

- Share know your rights information
- Create a plan for if enforcement arrives
- Identify trusted coworkers who can help

### Know Your Employer's Policies

- Ask if your employer has a policy on immigration enforcement
- Advocate for worker-protective policies
- Know if your employer will provide legal support

### Emergency Contacts at Work

Keep accessible (not on your phone if possible):
- Immigration attorney number
- Your cell's legal contact
- Family emergency contact
- Union representative (if applicable)

## If a Coworker is Taken

1. **Document**: Names, badge numbers, time, where they were taken
2. **Do not interfere physically**
3. **Contact their emergency contact**
4. **Alert your cell through secure channels**
5. **Consider organizing support** (legal funds, family support)

## Union Protections

If you're in a union:
- Your union may have specific protections
- Contact your union representative
- Collective bargaining agreements may limit employer cooperation with ICE
