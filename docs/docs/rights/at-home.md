# At Home

Your home has the strongest legal protections. Officers generally cannot enter without a warrant signed by a judge.

## If Officers Come to Your Door

### Step 1: Don't Open the Door

You do not have to open the door. Speak through the closed door:

> "Who are you and what do you want?"

### Step 2: Ask to See the Warrant

If they claim to have a warrant:

> "Please slip the warrant under the door."

**Check the warrant carefully:**
- Is it signed by a judge?
- Is your name or address on it?
- Is it an ICE administrative warrant or a judicial warrant?

::: warning ICE Administrative Warrants
ICE warrants (Form I-200 or I-205) are NOT signed by a judge. You do NOT have to open the door for these.

Only a **judicial warrant** signed by a judge requires you to open the door.

### Step 3: If They Have a Valid Judicial Warrant

If they have a valid warrant signed by a judge with your name/address:
- You may need to let them in
- You can still remain silent
- Ask for an attorney immediately

### Step 4: If They Do Not Have a Valid Warrant

If they don't have a judicial warrant, you can say:

> "I do not consent to your entry. Please leave."

You can also say:

> "I am exercising my right to remain silent."

## If They Enter Anyway

Even if officers enter without proper authority:

- **Do not resist physically** — this can lead to additional charges
- **State clearly**: "I do not consent to this search"
- **Remain silent** — do not answer questions
- **Remember badge numbers, names, what was taken**
- **Contact your legal support immediately**

## Preparing Your Home

### Family Safety Plan

- Designate a trusted person outside your home to care for children
- Keep important documents with that person (birth certificates, passports, medical records)
- Make sure children know who to contact and what to do
- Create a code word to alert family that something is wrong

### Document Storage

- Keep copies of important documents with trusted people
- Know where originals are located
- Consider a fireproof safe or safe deposit box

### Emergency Contacts

Post these somewhere accessible:
- Immigration attorney phone number
- Your cell's legal contact
- Trusted family member
- Children's school/emergency contacts

## If Someone in Your Home is Taken

1. **Document everything**: Names, badge numbers, time, what happened
2. **Do not interfere physically**
3. **Contact your cell's legal support immediately**
4. **Request information**: Where are they being taken? Under what charges?
5. **Contact an immigration attorney**
