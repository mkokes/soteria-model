## Your Core Rights

### The Right to Remain Silent

You have the right not to answer questions from police or immigration officers. You can say:

> "I am exercising my right to remain silent."

You do not have to answer questions about:
- Where you were born
- Your immigration status
- How you entered the country

### The Right to Refuse Consent to Search

Officers need a warrant to search your home. If they don't have one, you can say:

> "I do not consent to a search."

### The Right to an Attorney

If you are detained, you have the right to speak with a lawyer before answering questions. You can say:

> "I want to speak with an attorney."

### The Right Not to Sign

You do not have to sign anything you don't understand or agree with.
