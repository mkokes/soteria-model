# In Public

You have rights in public spaces, though they are more limited than at home. Here's how to protect yourself.

## If Approached by Officers

### Stay Calm

- Keep your hands visible
- Do not run
- Do not resist physically

### Ask if You Are Free to Go

> "Am I free to go?"

If yes, walk away calmly. If no, you are being detained.

### Exercise Your Right to Silence

> "I am exercising my right to remain silent."

You do not have to answer questions about:
- Your name (in most states)
- Where you were born
- Your immigration status
- Where you are going

::: tip STATE VARIATIONS
Some states require you to identify yourself if lawfully detained. Check your state's laws, but you never have to answer questions about immigration status.

### Do Not Consent to Searches

> "I do not consent to a search."

Officers may pat you down for weapons if they have reasonable suspicion, but you do not have to consent to further searches.

## Specific Public Situations

### Grocery Store / Shopping

- You cannot be detained simply for shopping
- Store security has limited authority
- If police arrive, exercise your rights

### Public Transportation

- On buses and trains, you have the same rights
- Border Patrol may operate checkpoints within 100 miles of borders
- Even at checkpoints, you can remain silent about immigration status

### Walking on the Street

- Police need reasonable suspicion to stop you
- You can ask: "Am I being detained?"
- If not, you can walk away

### At a Protest or Public Gathering

- You have First Amendment rights to protest
- Carry ID if you choose to (not required everywhere)
- Know your local legal observer hotline

## The 100-Mile Border Zone

Border Patrol has expanded authority within 100 miles of any US border (including coastlines). This covers about 2/3 of the US population.

**Even in this zone:**
- You can remain silent
- You can refuse consent to vehicle searches (though they may search anyway)
- You do not have to answer questions about immigration status

## If You Are Detained in Public

1. **Stay calm and do not resist**
2. **Say clearly**: "I am exercising my right to remain silent. I want to speak with an attorney."
3. **Do not sign anything**
4. **Remember**: badge numbers, agency (police, ICE, CBP), time, location
5. **Contact your cell or attorney as soon as possible**

## Safety Tips

### Before Going Out

- Tell someone where you're going and when you'll return
- Carry your rights card
- Know your legal contact number by heart
- Consider the Transporter segment for high-risk trips

### If You See Immigration Enforcement

- Do not approach or interfere
- Document from a safe distance if possible
- Alert your cell through secure channels
- You have the right to observe and record (from a safe distance)
