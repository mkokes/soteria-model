# If Detained

If you or a loved one is detained by immigration authorities, here's what you need to know.

## Immediately After Detention

### Stay Calm

Resistance can lead to additional charges. Stay calm even though it's frightening.

### Exercise Your Rights

Say clearly:

> "I am exercising my right to remain silent. I want to speak with an attorney."

Repeat this if asked questions.

### Do Not Sign Anything

You may be pressured to sign documents. Do not sign anything you don't understand or without consulting an attorney.

::: danger VOLUNTARY DEPARTURE
You may be asked to sign a "voluntary departure" order. This gives up your right to see a judge. Do NOT sign without consulting an attorney.

### Request a Phone Call

You have the right to make phone calls. Use them wisely:

1. **Call your immigration attorney** (or your cell's legal contact)
2. **Call your family emergency contact**
3. **If possible**, let your cell know through a trusted intermediary

## Finding a Detained Person

If someone is detained and you don't know where:

### Online Detainee Locator

ICE maintains an online locator:
[https://locator.ice.gov](https://locator.ice.gov)

You'll need:
- Full legal name
- Country of birth
- Date of birth

### Call the Detention Facility

If you know the facility, call directly. Be persistent.

### Contact an Immigration Attorney

An attorney can file paperwork to locate someone and get access.

## Rights While Detained

Even while detained, you have rights:

| Right | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Remain silent | You can refuse to answer questions |
| Attorney | You can consult with a lawyer |
| Medical care | You should receive necessary medical treatment |
| Phone calls | You can make calls (may be at your expense) |
| Bond hearing | You may be eligible for release on bond |
| See a judge | In most cases, you have the right to see an immigration judge |

## Bond and Release

### Bond Hearing

Many detained people are eligible for a bond hearing. A judge decides whether you can be released and at what amount.

**Factors that help:**
- Community ties (family, job, home)
- No serious criminal history
- Not considered a flight risk

### Paying Bond

If bond is granted:
- Bond can be paid by family or friends
- Immigration bond companies exist (research carefully)
- Your cell's Resource segment may be able to help

## Deportation Proceedings

If detained, you will likely be in removal (deportation) proceedings. You have the right to:

- See an immigration judge
- Present evidence in your defense
- Appeal a deportation order
- Have an attorney (but not provided free by the government)

### Fighting Your Case

Many people have defenses to deportation:
- Asylum or fear of persecution
- Cancellation of removal
- Family-based relief
- U-visa (for crime victims)
- Other forms of relief

**Get an attorney.** Immigration law is complex.

## For Family Members

If your loved one is detained:

1. **Stay calm** — panicking doesn't help
2. **Find an immigration attorney immediately**
3. **Gather documents**: birth certificates, marriage certificates, tax records, proof of residence
4. **Care for children**: Activate your family safety plan
5. **Contact your cell**: They can provide support and resources
6. **Document everything**: When they were taken, by whom, from where

### Children

If a parent is detained:
- Children should go to the designated trusted adult
- Schools should have emergency contact information
- Keep copies of birth certificates accessible
- Consider a notarized caregiver authorization

## Support Your Cell Provides

Depending on your cell's capacity:

- **Legal Observers**: Connect you with attorneys, accompany to hearings
- **Resource Network**: Help with legal fees, family support
- **Transporters**: Get family to visitation, court dates
- **Emotional support**: You are not alone
