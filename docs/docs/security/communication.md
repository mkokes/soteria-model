# Communication OpSec

How you communicate is as important as what you communicate. This guide covers secure communication practices.

## Signal: The Primary Channel

All cell communication happens on Signal. Not text messages. Not WhatsApp. Not email. Signal.

### Why Only Signal?

| Platform | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| SMS/Text | Not encrypted, stored by carrier |
| WhatsApp | Owned by Meta, metadata collected |
| Telegram | Not encrypted by default |
| Email | Not encrypted, stored on servers |
| Social media DMs | Monitored, stored, often compelled |

Signal provides end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, and minimal metadata retention.

### When Signal Isn't Available

If you must communicate outside Signal:
- Keep it vague and brief
- Don't mention the cell, activities, or members
- Move to Signal as soon as possible
- Consider a phone call (still vulnerable, but less permanent than text)

## What to Communicate — and What Not To

### Safe to Discuss

- Meeting times and general logistics
- General updates and check-ins
- Training information
- Public know-your-rights information
- Resource needs (generally, not specific individuals)

### Never Discuss

Even on Signal, avoid:

| Topic | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Specific names of community members receiving help | Protects them if device seized |
| Detailed locations (addresses, safe houses) | Location information is high-risk |
| Future enforcement information | Could be misconstrued as conspiracy |
| Other segments' activities | Compartmentalization |
| Photographs of activities or people | Visual evidence persists |

### The Test

Before sending, ask:
> "If this message were read by ICE, would it put anyone at risk?"

If yes, don't send it — or rephrase.

## Disappearing Messages

All cell conversations should have disappearing messages enabled:

| Context | Recommended Timer |
|---------|------------------|
| Day-to-day coordination | 1 week |
| Sensitive discussions | 1 day |
| Highly sensitive | 1 hour |
| Announcements | 1 week - 1 month |

Messages that disappear can't be used against you.

## Voice and Video Calls

Signal also provides encrypted calls:

- Use for sensitive discussions not appropriate for text
- Enable "Always Relay Calls" to hide your IP address
- Still be cautious — you're speaking aloud, can be overheard

## Group Communication

### Group Hygiene

- Remove members promptly when they leave
- Review membership regularly
- Don't add members without proper vetting
- Admins should be stewards

### One-Way Announcements

For cell-wide announcements:
- Consider a separate "announcements" group
- Only admins can post
- Reduces noise and potential for mistakes

### Reply Carefully

In group chats:
- Don't quote-reply messages that should have disappeared
- Don't forward messages between groups
- Be aware that everyone in the group sees your message

## Metadata Considerations

Even with encryption, some information is visible:

| Metadata | Visibility |
|----------|------------|
| Who you're messaging | Your phone, their phone |
| When you're messaging | Signal servers (briefly) |
| How often you message | Your phone |
| Group membership | Group members |

Signal minimizes metadata collection, but it's not zero. Consider:
- Your phone's screen lock (prevents casual access)
- Who might look at your phone (family, employer, police)

## In-Person Communication

Sometimes the most secure channel is no channel:

- Sensitive decisions should happen in person when possible
- No devices present (or in another room)
- No notes taken
- Agreed summary shared afterward if needed

## Social Media

### Personal Accounts

- Don't discuss cell activities
- Don't post about activities, locations, or members
- Don't identify yourself as part of the network
- Be aware that your associations are visible

### Cell Social Media

Generally, cells should not have public social media. If you do:
- Never mention specific activities
- Never post photos that identify people
- Keep it to general know-your-rights information
- Have a policy for what can be posted
