# Physical Security

Digital security matters, but so does the physical world. Where you meet, what you carry, and what you observe all affect safety.

## Meeting Locations

### Choosing Locations

For sensitive meetings:

**Good locations:**
- Private homes (of trusted members)
- Private rooms in community spaces
- Outdoor locations with good sight lines
- Rotating locations

**Avoid:**
- The same location repeatedly
- Anywhere with cameras you don't control
- Public spaces where you might be overheard
- Locations that could identify the group's purpose

### Device Policy

For sensitive meetings, consider:
- Devices left in another room
- Devices in a bag/container away from discussion
- At minimum: devices on airplane mode, face-down

### Who Attends

Only those who need to be present should attend:
- Don't bring others without prior agreement
- If someone unexpected arrives, be cautious
- Meeting organizers should know who's coming

## Awareness and Counter-Surveillance

### Be Observant

Pay attention to:
- Vehicles parked near frequent locations (especially occupied)
- The same person appearing in different places
- People who seem to be watching or following
- Drones in the area

This isn't paranoia — it's awareness. Most of the time it's nothing. But noticing when it's something matters.

### Varying Routines

If you're regularly involved in activities:
- Vary your routes to meetings
- Don't arrive at the same time every time
- Use different entrances when available
- Avoid patterns

### Surveillance Detection

If you believe you're being followed:
- Stay calm, don't confront
- Note details (vehicle, description, behavior)
- Vary your route — does the tail follow?
- Go to a public place, not home
- Alert your cell through secure channels

## Paper and Physical Records

### The Rule: Keep Nothing

The safest record is no record. Don't keep:
- Lists of members or community members
- Activity logs or calendars
- Notes from meetings
- Paper copies of sensitive information

### If You Must Keep Records

Sometimes records are necessary. If so:
- Keep them in a secure location (safe, locked drawer)
- Minimize identifying information
- Shred when no longer needed
- Have a plan to destroy quickly if necessary

### Printed Materials

For trainings or events with printed materials:
- Collect materials at the end
- Shred or securely dispose
- Don't leave materials in public places

## Personal Safety

### General Awareness

- Trust your instincts — if something feels wrong, it might be
- Have check-in systems for activities
- Know how to contact someone if you don't return
- Carry your rights card

### During Activities

Depending on the activity:
- Work in pairs when possible
- Have a check-in schedule
- Know when to disengage
- Don't escalate confrontations

### De-escalation

If confronted by hostile individuals:
- Stay calm
- Do not engage physically
- Leave the situation if possible
- Document after, not during
- Report to your segment lead

## Home Security

Your home may be of interest if you're active in the cell:

- Know your rights at home ([At Home](/rights/at-home))
- Don't keep sensitive materials at home
- Have a family safety plan
- Brief household members on what to do if authorities arrive

## Photography and Video

### General Rule: Don't

Photographs are evidence. They identify people. They persist.

- Don't take photos at activities
- Don't photograph community members receiving support
- Don't post anything that identifies participants

### When Documentation is Appropriate

Legal observers may document rights violations, but:
- Only with training
- Only with consent when possible
- Only when it serves the person's interests
- Never shared without permission
