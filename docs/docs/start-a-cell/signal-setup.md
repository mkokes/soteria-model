# Setting Up Signal

Signal is the recommended communication platform for Soteria cells. It provides end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, and is widely trusted by security professionals.

## Why Signal?

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| End-to-end encryption | Only sender and recipient can read messages |
| Open source | Code can be audited for security |
| Disappearing messages | Reduces data if device is seized |
| No message metadata stored | Signal doesn't keep logs of who you message |
| Screen security | Can prevent screenshots |
| Registration lock | Prevents SIM-swap attacks |

## Individual Setup

Every member should configure Signal properly:

### Step 1: Install Signal

Download only from official sources:
- [signal.org](https://signal.org/download/)
- Official app stores (iOS App Store, Google Play)

Never download from third-party sites.

### Step 2: Register

- Use a phone number you control
- Consider using a number not tied to your identity (prepaid, Google Voice)

### Step 3: Configure Security Settings

Open Signal Settings and configure:

**Privacy Settings:**
- [x] Screen Lock: ON (with PIN or biometric)
- [x] Screen Security: ON (prevents screenshots)
- [x] Registration Lock: ON (prevents SIM-swap hijacking)
- [x] Always Relay Calls: Consider ON (hides IP address)

**Chat Settings:**
- [x] Default Disappearing Messages: 1 week (or shorter for sensitive groups)

### Step 4: Verify Safety Numbers

When communicating with other cell members, verify safety numbers:
1. Open conversation
2. Tap contact name at top
3. Tap "View Safety Number"
4. Compare numbers in person or via video call

This confirms you're talking to the right person, not an impersonator.

## Group Structure

### Recommended Groups

Create separate groups for each segment and function:

```
Cell Groups
├── Stewards Coordination (founders + stewards only)
├── Sentinels Segment
├── Transporters Segment
├── Resources Segment
├── Business Allies Segment
├── Legal Observers Segment
└── Announcements (one-way, cell-wide)
```

### Group Naming

**Don't use obvious names.** Instead of "Austin Soteria Transporters," use:
- Neutral code names
- Unrelated themes (book clubs, sports teams, hobby groups)
- Numbers or letters

Agree on naming convention within your cell.

### Group Settings

For each group:
- **Disappearing messages**: ON (1 week or less)
- **Group link**: OFF (prevents joining without admin approval)
- **Add members**: Admin-only
- **Edit group info**: Admin-only

### Admin Practices

- At least 2 admins per group (redundancy)
- Remove members promptly when they leave
- Regularly review member list
- Admin devices must have highest security

## Communication Protocols

### What to Discuss on Signal

- Coordination and logistics
- Scheduling
- General updates
- Training information

### What NOT to Discuss on Signal

Even with encryption, be cautious about:
- Specific locations of vulnerable individuals
- Detailed personal information
- Anything that would be damaging if read by authorities
- Names of undocumented community members

**Assume messages could be compromised.** Encryption protects transit — not a seized device.

### Code Words (Optional)

Some cells develop code words for common situations:
- "The weather is changing" = enforcement activity observed
- "Book club is cancelled" = stand down, security concern
- "Need a recipe" = requesting transportation

Keep code systems simple. Complex codes get forgotten.
