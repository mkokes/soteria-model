# Support Local Businesses

Immigrant-owned businesses are the backbone of our communities. When they're targeted for harassment, we stand with them. When they thrive, we all thrive.

## Why Business Support Matters

- **Economic solidarity**: Your dollars directly support families in our community
- **Visible presence**: A busy business is a protected business
- **Community strength**: Thriving businesses create thriving neighborhoods
- **Resistance**: Choosing where to spend is a form of mutual aid

## Ways to Support

### 🛒 Shop & Patronize

The simplest and most powerful action: **spend money at immigrant-owned businesses**.

- Make them your regular stops for groceries, restaurants, services
- Bring friends and family
- Leave positive reviews online

### 👥 Presence & Witness

If a business is being harassed:

- **Show up**: A crowd of supporters deters harassment
- **Witness**: Document incidents (with consent)
- **De-escalate**: Stay calm, don't engage with harassers
- **Report**: Let the Business Allies segment know

### 📣 Amplify

- Share their business on social media
- Recommend them to friends
- Write positive reviews on Google, Yelp
- Feature them in community newsletters

### 🤝 Organize Buy-In Days

Coordinate community-wide days to support specific businesses:
- Pick a day and a business
- Spread the word through community networks
- Show up together
