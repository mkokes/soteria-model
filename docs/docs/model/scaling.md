# Scaling

The Soteria Model is designed to scale — both within a cell and across communities. Scaling is always **optional** and **locally decided**.

## Scaling Within a Cell

As a cell grows, it may need to distribute workload:

### Adding Co-Stewards

When one steward is overwhelmed:

| Sign | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Response times slowing | Add co-steward to share load |
| Single point of failure | Cross-train backup steward |
| Burnout risk | Rotate responsibilities |

### Subdividing Segments

When a segment grows beyond ~15 members, consider:

- **Geographic split**: East/West, North/South, by neighborhood
- **Functional split**: Drivers vs. dispatchers, sorters vs. distributors
- **Time-based split**: Daytime team vs. evening team

Each sub-segment gets its own Signal group and lead.

### Regional Coordinators

For cells covering large areas:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     CITY CELL                           │
│                                                         │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐     │
│  │   North     │  │   Central   │  │   South     │     │
│  │   Region    │  │   Region    │  │   Region    │     │
│  └──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘     │
│         │                │                │             │
│         └────────────────┼────────────────┘             │
│                          │                              │
│                 ┌────────▼────────┐                     │
│                 │ Regional Leads  │                     │
│                 │  Coordination   │                     │
│                 └─────────────────┘                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Regional coordinators handle logistics for their area while maintaining cell-wide security practices.

## When NOT to Scale

Scaling is optional. Some contexts work better staying small:

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Small/remote town | Single cell may serve indefinitely |
| Low activity level | Don't create structure you don't need |
| Trust network still developing | Grow trust before growing structure |
| External pressure increasing | Consolidate rather than expand |

**Smaller can be safer.** More structure means more complexity and more potential failure points.

## Spawning New Cells

When a new community wants to start:

### Seed Group Method

1. **Identify founders**: 3-5 people from the new area, vouched by existing network
2. **Training**: Founders receive full steward-level training
3. **Independence**: New cell operates autonomously from day one
4. **No hierarchy**: Original cell has no authority over new cell

### Knowledge Sharing (Optional)

Cells may choose to share:
- Updated legal information
- Security practice improvements
- Template refinements
- General lessons learned

Cells should NOT share:
- Member lists
- Operational details
- Communication channels
- Internal structure specifics

### Liaison Model (Optional)

If cells want ongoing connection:

```
┌──────────────┐          ┌──────────────┐
│   Cell A     │          │   Cell B     │
│              │          │              │
│  ┌────────┐  │          │  ┌────────┐  │
│  │Liaison │◄─┼──────────┼─►│Liaison │  │
│  └────────┘  │          │  └────────┘  │
└──────────────┘          └──────────────┘
```

- One designated person per cell for inter-cell communication
- Shares only non-operational information
- Cannot commit their cell to anything

## Scaling Principles

1. **Scale when needed, not when possible** — Don't create structure for its own sake
2. **Local decisions** — Each cell/segment decides when and how to scale
3. **Maintain compartmentalization** — Scaling should not break security boundaries
4. **Document as you grow** — Larger structures need clearer processes
5. **Autonomy over efficiency** — Independent cells are safer than coordinated ones
