# Cell Structure

A **cell** is the fundamental organizational unit of the Soteria Model. It's a local, autonomous network that operates independently.

## What is a Cell?

A cell is a community-based mutual aid network, typically organized around:

- A **city or town**
- A **neighborhood** in larger metros
- A **geographic region** in rural areas
- A **community** (cultural, religious, workplace)

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each cell contains:
- **Segments** — Functional teams (see [Segments](/model/segments))
- **Stewards** — Coordination roles (see [Stewards](/model/stewards))
- **Members** — Trusted individuals within segments

## Cell Independence

Cells operate autonomously:

| What Cells Share | What Cells Don't Share |
|------------------|------------------------|
| This blueprint | Member lists |
| Legal updates | Operational details |
| Security advisories | Internal communications |
| Template improvements | Locations or routes |

There is no "national Soteria organization." Each cell is sovereign.

## Starting a Cell

A cell begins with a **founding team** of 3-5 trusted individuals who:

1. Know each other well and trust each other deeply
2. Commit to the [Core Principles](/model/principles)
3. Complete security training together
4. Establish initial segments based on local needs
5. Begin vouching in new members carefully

See [Start a Cell](/start-a-cell/) for detailed guidance.

## Scaling a Cell

As cells grow, they may choose to subdivide. This is **optional** — each cell decides what works for their context.

| Situation | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| Segment growing large (15+ members) | Add co-leads, split by function or geography |
| Cell covering wide area | Create regional sub-cells or area coordinators |
| Small/remote community | Maintain single cell indefinitely |

The **15-person guideline**: Groups larger than ~15 become harder to maintain trust and coordinate. When segments grow, consider subdivision — but it's always a local decision.

## Cell Security

- No cell should have complete knowledge of another cell
- If cells coordinate, it's through designated liaisons only
- A compromised cell cannot compromise the network
