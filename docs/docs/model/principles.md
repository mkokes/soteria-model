# Core Principles

These principles are non-negotiable. They define what makes the Soteria Model work.

## 1. Compartmentalization

**Segments don't overlap. Information doesn't flow freely.**

- Someone doing surveillance observation never knows transportation routes
- Someone distributing resources never knows safe house locations
- Coordinators know other coordinators, not every member

This protects everyone. What you don't know, you cannot reveal — whether through accident, coercion, or compromise.

## 2. Vouching Over Recruitment

**Every member is personally vouched for by someone trusted.**

- No open applications, no public sign-ups
- A voucher takes responsibility for their referral
- Trust is built through relationship, not paperwork

This creates a **web of trust** that is resistant to infiltration.

## 3. Autonomy

**Each cell operates independently. There is no central authority.**

- No national organization to subpoena
- No database to seize
- No leader whose compromise takes down everything

Cells may share knowledge (updated legal info, security practices), but never operational details.

## 4. Privacy by Design

**We collect nothing we don't absolutely need.**

- No lists of vulnerable community members on any system
- No photos, addresses, or identifying information stored digitally
- Coordination happens through encrypted channels that disappear

The safest data is data that doesn't exist.

## 5. Replicability

**This model is designed to be copied.**

- The blueprint is public and open source
- Any community can fork it and adapt to local needs
- We succeed when this spreads, not when we grow

## 6. Solidarity Over Charity

**We are neighbors protecting neighbors, not providers serving clients.**

- Community members are participants, not recipients
- Those receiving support today may provide it tomorrow
- Everyone has something to contribute

## 7. Harm Reduction

**We meet people where they are.**

- We don't require documentation or proof of status
- We don't judge circumstances or decisions
- We provide what's needed without conditions

## Living These Principles

These aren't just words — they shape every decision:

| Decision | Principle Applied |
|----------|------------------|
| Should we keep a spreadsheet of rides given? | **No** — Privacy by Design |
| Can a Sentinel also do transportation? | **No** — Compartmentalization |
| Someone wants to join but nobody knows them | **Not yet** — Vouching |
| Another city wants our member list to coordinate | **No** — Autonomy |
| Should we brand ourselves prominently? | **Carefully** — Replicability over visibility |
