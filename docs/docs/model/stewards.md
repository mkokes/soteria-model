# Steward Roles

**Stewards** are coordination roles that keep the cell functioning. They are not leaders in a hierarchical sense — they are facilitators who hold specific responsibilities.

## Core Steward Roles

### Segment Leads

**Responsibility**: Coordinate activities within ONE segment only.

- Manage the segment's Signal group
- Onboard new members to the segment (after vetting)
- Match volunteers to needs within the segment
- Ensure segment members follow security practices

**Visibility**: Only their own segment members. Does not know members of other segments.

### Logistics Coordinators

**Responsibility**: Match needs to resources across the cell without knowing identities.

- Receive requests (anonymized or minimal info)
- Route requests to appropriate segment leads
- Track capacity without tracking people
- Identify gaps in coverage

**Visibility**: Sees segment leads, sees request types — does NOT see member identities or operational details.

---

### Onboarding Stewards

**Responsibility**: Vet and train new members before they join a segment.

- Conduct initial conversations with prospects
- Verify vouching from existing members
- Deliver security training
- Assign to appropriate segment after probationary period

**Visibility**: Knows new prospects and their vouchers only. Does not have ongoing access to segment membership.

### Communications Steward

**Responsibility**: Maintain secure communication infrastructure.

- Set up and manage Signal groups
- Ensure proper group permissions and settings
- Respond to security incidents (compromised devices, etc.)
- Train members on communication security

**Visibility**: Knows group structure — does NOT participate in operational discussions.

## Steward Principles

### 1. Stewards Are Servants, Not Bosses

Stewardship is responsibility, not authority. Stewards facilitate; they don't command.

### 2. Stewards Know Other Stewards

For coordination, stewards may know each other. This is a limited exception to segment isolation.

```
     Segment Lead ←→ Logistics Coordinator
           ↑                  ↑
           └──────────────────┘
              (Know each other)
              
     Segment Members ✗ Other Segment Members
              (Do NOT know each other)
```

### 3. Stewards Can Be Removed

If a steward violates principles, the cell can remove them. No one is irreplaceable.

### 4. Rotate When Possible

Concentrated knowledge is concentrated risk. Where practical, rotate steward roles.

## Becoming a Steward

Stewards emerge from trusted members who:

1. Have been active in a segment for significant time (6+ months suggested)
2. Demonstrate commitment to security practices
3. Are vouched for by multiple existing members
4. Complete additional steward training
5. Are confirmed by existing stewards

This is not a promotion — it's accepting additional responsibility.

## Steward Security

Stewards hold more knowledge than regular members. Extra precautions:

- Stewards should have the strongest device security
- Stewards should use separate devices for coordination if possible
- Stewards should have a succession plan (who takes over if they're unavailable)
- Stewards should regularly audit their own access (do I need to know this?)
