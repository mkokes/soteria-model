# Segments

**Segments** are specialized teams within a cell, each with a distinct function. The key security feature: **segments are isolated from each other**.

## Core Segments

These are the foundational segments. Cells may adapt based on local needs.

### Sentinels (Observation)

**Purpose**: Monitor and report suspicious activity to protect the community.

**Activities**:
- Watch for unmarked vehicles conducting surveillance
- Note patterns of ICE or law enforcement activity
- Report sightings through secure channels
- Provide early warning to the community

**Never involved in**: Transportation, resource distribution, or knowing safe locations.

### Transporters

**Purpose**: Provide safe transportation to essential destinations.

**Activities**:
- Drive community members to work, medical appointments, grocery stores
- Pick up children from school when parents cannot
- Provide rides to legal appointments or court dates

**Never involved in**: Observation/sentinel activities, knowing safe house locations.

---

### Resource Network

**Purpose**: Collect and distribute supplies, funds, and essentials.

**Activities**:
- Organize food and supply drives
- Manage emergency funds for legal fees, rent, bail
- Coordinate with local mutual aid for material needs
- Distribute resources through trusted channels

**Never involved in**: Observation, transportation routes, or safe house locations.

### Business Allies

**Purpose**: Support and protect immigrant-owned businesses.

**Activities**:
- Patronize targeted businesses
- Provide presence during harassment incidents
- Organize community "buy-in" days
- De-escalation and witness presence

**Never involved in**: Sensitive operational activities in other segments.

---

### Legal Observers

**Purpose**: Train community on rights and connect to legal resources.

**Activities**:
- Conduct Know Your Rights trainings
- Provide legal observer presence at sensitive locations
- Connect community members with immigration attorneys
- Document rights violations (with consent)

**Role**: Legal observers may work across segments for training purposes, but do not participate in operational activities of other segments.

## Segment Isolation

This is the core security principle:

| Segment | Knows | Doesn't Know |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Sentinels | Observation protocols, reporting channels | Transportation routes, resource locations |
| Transporters | Pickup/dropoff points for their rides | Sentinel identities, safe houses |
| Resources | Distribution methods, supply sources | Member identities in other segments |
| Business Allies | Business locations, de-escalation tactics | Sensitive operational details |
| Legal Observers | Training content, legal contacts | Operational details of any segment |

**Why this matters**: If any one person is compromised — through arrest, coercion, or infiltration — they can only reveal what their segment knows. The rest of the network remains protected.

## Creating Segments

Not every cell needs every segment. Start with what your community needs most:

- High surveillance activity? → Start with **Sentinels**
- People afraid to leave home? → Start with **Transporters**
- Businesses being targeted? → Start with **Business Allies**
- People don't know their rights? → Start with **Legal Observers**

Add segments as capacity and need grows.

## Segment Size

**Guideline**: Keep segments to roughly 15 members or fewer. Larger groups:
- Are harder to coordinate
- Have weaker trust bonds
- Present greater risk if compromised

When a segment grows beyond this, consider:
- Adding co-leads
- Splitting by geography (East/West)
- Splitting by function (drivers vs. dispatchers)

This is guidance, not a rule. Each cell decides.
